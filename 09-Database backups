Database backup strategies

The planing of backup strategy
You will have to define backup strategy based on two factors.
-Maximum amount of data loss that can be tolerated
  It depends pm frequency of transaction log backups.
-Accepted time frame for database to be restored in case of disaster.

The first question involves taking multiple transaction log backups
Second question involves the use of high availabilty solutions

Why backups?
Backups are taken in order to restore database to its original state it was just before the disaster.
To protect against the hardware failure, malicious damage, user-error and database corruption.


Different kinds of backups

Full backup - A complete page by page copy of an entire database including all the data, all the structures and all other objects stored in database.

Differntial backups - Backup of data that has been changed since the last full backup.

Transaction log - Backup of all committed transactions currently stored in the transaction log.

Copy-only backup - User backup which is independent of regular sequence of SQL server backups.

File backup - A bakcup of one or more database files or filegroups

Partial backup - Contains database from some of the file groups in a database

Where backup should be placed?
Ideally, backups should be placed on their own drives onto servers saparate from production server.
Use thrir party application to copy it to remote server on a separate site.
We should not tolerate backups on same drive and server being used for data and log file

Which databases should we backup in production?
All including system and user defined, except tempdb.

Backup retention period will be deretmined by business.

Full backup - It includes whole database, part of transaction log needed to recover database using full backup.
