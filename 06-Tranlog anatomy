fn_dblog is a function with begning and end LSN as input parameters to look inside the transaction log.
We use null for both start and end LSN. 
The following example will show how the transaction log records multiple rows of data for any activity against database.
How a tran log backup truncate the T-file after copying commited transactions to backup files.

Do not use the function in production as it is undocumented.


--Drop database if exists

exec msdb.dbo.sp_delete_database_backuphistory @database_name = 'viewlogs'
go
use master
go
alter database viewlogs set single_user with rollback immediate;
go
use master
go
drop database viewlogs;

use master
go
create database viewlogs
containment = none
on primary
(name = 'viewlogs', filename = 'D:/..../viewlogs.mdf', size = 1024kb,maxsize = unlimited, filegrowth = 1024kb)
log on
(name = 'viewlogs_log',filename = 'D:/..../viewlogs_log.ldf', size=51200kb,maxsize = unlimited, filegrowth = 1024kb)
go

alter database set recovery full;

use viewlogs
crate table cities(city varchar(30);
go

--view the row count for the activty shuch as create database, create table in trnsaction log
select count(*) from fn_dblog(null, null)

--Take full db backup
backup database viewlogs to disk = 'D:\....bak';
-- Database backup will not tuncate the transaction log.
select count(*) from fn_dblog(null, null)
insert into cities values('NewYork');
go 1000

select count(*) from fn_dblog(null, null)    --< 3060 rows

--trnaction log backup will truncate the log
backup log viewlogs to disk = 'D:/.....bak';
select count(*) from fn_dblog(null, null)     --< 89 rows

What are VLF blocks?

use viewlogs
dbcc loginfo    --< to check number of vlfs in transaction logfile
sp_helpdb viewlogs
DBname, size, owner,dbid,created,status,compatibilty_level,file infoormation(mdf, ldf)

--To check logspace used
dbcc sqlperf(logspace)
DBname, log size, %used, status

Autogrowth creates more VLFs and impacts performance.
Reduce the frequency of auto growth kiking in.
To solve the issue, always do pre-sizing and use autogrowth only for safety reasons.
